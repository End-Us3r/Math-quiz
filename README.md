# Math-quiz

This is a Python program that generates addition or subtraction problems for the user to solve. It uses the "random" module to generate two random numbers, which are added or subtracted based on the user's choice. The user is prompted to enter their answer and given feedback on whether it is correct or incorrect. The program keeps track of the number of guesses it takes the user to arrive at the correct answer. The program also displays a menu with options to choose from and exit the program.
